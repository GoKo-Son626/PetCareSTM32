# PetCareSTM32

## Description
PetCareSTM32 is an advanced project utilizing STM32 microcontroller technology to manage and monitor pet habitats effectively. The system captures environmental data, displays it in real-time, and automates various habitat functions, including feeding and humidity control. This project is scalable and can be adapted for different types of pets.

## Features
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracks temperature and humidity using sensors.
- **Real-Time Display**: Shows data on an LCD or OLED screen.
- **Automated Control**: Uses PWM for precise control of fans, lights, and other devices.
- **Feeding Mechanism**: Automates pet feeding with motor-driven systems.
- **Scalability**: Designed to integrate additional features such as cameras and advanced sensors.

## Components
- STM32 Microcontroller Board
- Temperature and Humidity Sensors (DHT11/DHT22)
- LCD/OLED Display
- PWM Control Module
- Motor Driver (L298N)
- Fan
- Additional optional components

## Getting Started
1. **Hardware Integration**: Assemble and connect all necessary components to the STM32 board.
2. **Software Configuration**: Utilize STM32CubeMX for peripheral setup and STM32CubeIDE for coding.
3. **Testing Phases**: Conduct thorough testing of each module to ensure functionality.
4. **Deployment**: Install the system in the pet habitat and monitor its operation.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding camera integration for live monitoring.
- Expanding sensor and actuator capabilities.
- Developing an accompanying mobile application for enhanced user interaction.
